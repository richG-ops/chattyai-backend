# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Deploy VAPI Fix to Production

## Issue
The `/vapi` endpoint is returning 404 because the route file `routes/vapi-simple.js` is missing in production.

## Solution
I've created the missing file. You need to deploy it to Render.

## Steps to Deploy:

### Option 1: Git Push (Recommended)
```bash
# Add the new file
git add routes/vapi-simple.js

# Commit
git commit -m "Add missing VAPI simple route for voice AI integration"

# Push to trigger Render deployment
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Manual Upload via Render
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Navigate to your service: `chattyai-backend-clean`
3. Use the file manager to create `routes/vapi-simple.js`
4. Copy the content from the local file
5. Trigger a redeploy

## What This Fixes:
- âœ… `/vapi` endpoint will start working
- âœ… VAPI voice calls can check availability
- âœ… VAPI voice calls can book appointments
- âœ… Basic demo functionality restored

## After Deployment:
Test the endpoint is working:
```bash
curl -X POST https://chattyai-backend-clean.onrender.com/vapi \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"function":"checkAvailability","parameters":{}}'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "response": "I have availability tomorrow at 10 AM, 2 PM, and 4 PM. Which time works best for you?",
  "slots": [...]
}
```

## Timeline
This needs to be deployed IMMEDIATELY for the VAPI integration to work.
