### Double-Check Logic Framework

3. **File operations**: Verify path exists before operations
4. **Deployment**: Test locally ‚Üí staging ‚Üí production

### Alternate Mental Models Used
- **Reverse Engineering**: What could break? Work backwards
- **First Principles**: What is absolutely required? Build up
- **Systems Thinking**: How does each part affect the whole?

### Performance Optimizations
- Luna server: Added caching headers (3600s)
- Error handling: Graceful with proper status codes
- Logging: Structured with timestamps for debugging
