# 🚨 CRITICAL SMS UPDATE REQUIRED

## CURRENT ISSUE
SMS messages don't include Luna visual link

## REQUIRED CHANGE
In `google-calendar-api.js` line 1340, update customer SMS to include:
```
💫 Meet Luna: https://luna.thechattyai.com
```

## IMPLEMENTATION
After Luna server is deployed to production:

1. Get production URL (e.g., https://luna-visual.onrender.com)
2. Update DNS: luna.thechattyai.com → production URL
3. Modify line 1340 in google-calendar-api.js:

```javascript
await sendSMS(customerPhone,
  `Hi ${customerName}! Your ${serviceType} appointment is confirmed for ${confirmationTime}. 👩‍💼\n\nConfirmation: ${result.data.id}\n\nWe'll see you then! ✨\n\n    ✨ 👩‍💼 ✨\n   Luna AI Assistant\n\n💫 Meet Luna: https://luna.thechattyai.com\n📱 Call me: 702-776-0084`
);
```

## IMPACT
- Customers see Luna visual when clicking link
- Increased brand recognition
- Better engagement with AI assistant
