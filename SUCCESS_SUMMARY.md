```
❌ POST /vapi → 404 Not Found

---

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE & FIX**

### **Problem:**
- `routes/vapi-simple.js` file existed but was **NOT MOUNTED** in `google-calendar-api.js`
- Route loading logs showed success but `/vapi` was missing from route table

### **Solution Applied:**
```javascript
// Added to google-calendar-api.js line 695:
try {
  app.use('/vapi', require('./routes/vapi-simple'));
  console.log('✅ VAPI simple routes loaded successfully');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('❌ Failed to load VAPI simple routes:', error.message);
}
```

### **Deployment:**
- **Commit**: `2a03096` - "CRITICAL FIX: Add missing /vapi route mounting"
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully deployed
- **Time**: Fixed in 30 minutes from identification
