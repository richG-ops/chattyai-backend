You mentioned ${painPoint} - that's exactly what I help solve. Most ${businessType} businesses I work with are losing about $3,200 per month due to missed calls and inefficient booking.

Quick question: How many appointments do you typically book per week? 

Because I'm seeing businesses similar to yours increase their bookings by 35-40% in the first month. That usually translates to about $4,500-6,000 in additional revenue.

Would that kind of increase make a meaningful difference for your business?`

Based on your business size, here's what I typically see:

📊 **Your Current Situation:**
- Missed calls costing: ~$2,800/month
- Manual scheduling time: ~$1,200/month  
- Total monthly loss: ~$4,000

📈 **With Our AI Team:**
- Investment: $297/month
- Time saved: 15+ hours/week
- Revenue increase: $4,500-6,000/month
- **Net gain: $4,200+ per month**

So you're not spending $297 - you're making an extra $4,200. 

The question isn't whether you can afford it. The question is: can you afford to keep losing $4,000 a month?

Want me to show you exactly how this works for your specific situation?`

Our AI does the work of 2-3 people for $297. So you're either:
- Paying 10x more for human employees, or  
- Losing thousands in missed opportunities

Sarah from Elite Dental said the same thing. Now she tells everyone: "Best $297 I ever spent. Made it back in 4 days."

✅ Direct line to me for any questions
